<h1> About me </h1>
<p> Hello and welcome to my site! I am new to the field of web developing but am enjoying working with different tools and building functional projects. I have a bachelors degree from UCLA in Chicana and Chicano Studies and am currently part of a coding bootcamp at UCLA Extension. My goal is to become a full stack web developer and learn more about computer science. Topics that are also interesting to me include astronomy, library science, history of science, medicine, and technology and computer science. </p>
